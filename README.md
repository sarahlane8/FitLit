# FitLit

## Abstract
Welcome to FitLit! The purpose of this project was to interpret provided health-related user data and display it to a dashboard for a user to see. Specific learning goals of the project included:  
  * Implementing ES6 classes that communicate as needed
  * Using object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
  * Creating a responsive dashboard that is clear and easy to use
  * Writing reusable code that follows SRP
  * Implementing a testing suite using test driven development  

We implemented media queries to apply breakpoints to our dashboard design to ensure users could view it across multiple devices.
